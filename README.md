# Jazz-and-Deep-Learning
Generating Jazz music using an LSTM network

# Objective
You want to create a jazz music piece specially for your friend's birthday. However, you don't know to play any instruments or music composition. Fortunately, you know deep learning and can solve this problem using an LSTM network.
The network is trained to generate novel jazz solos in a style representative of a body of performed work.

# Dataset
The model is trained on a corpus of [Jazz music](./data)
IPython.display.Audio('./data/30s_seq.mp3')
